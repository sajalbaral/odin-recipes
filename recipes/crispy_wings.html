    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet 
            with aluminium foil and set a heat-proof wire rack inside. </li>
        <li>Pat dry chicken wings liberally with paper towels, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Transfer them 
            to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the baking powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper together, whisking well to combine,
            and sprinkle the mixture over the wings. Toss wings through the baking powder mixture until evenly coated. </li>
        <li>Arrange on rack, leaving about 1-inch of space between each wing.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes; flip and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, (about 20-30 minutes longer), 
            until golden browned and crispy.</li>
        <li>While wings are cooking, whisk together hot sauce, butter and sugar. Toss wings through the sauce to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing, and celery sticks.</li>
    </ol>
